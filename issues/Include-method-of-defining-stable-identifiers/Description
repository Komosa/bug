The directory index numbers used to identify bugs on
the command line is useful for small numbers of short 
lived bugs, but there should be a method of defining
more stable identifiers that stick with the bug for
longer-term issues.

Currently, you can give an issue a unique tag to look
it up in "bug list" easily, but that's abusing the tag
system and doesn't work with other commands.

Proposal:

Include an "Identifier" field file and commands to 
manipulate it. It can be manually set to anything.

Add a --generate-id option to bug create to create
a sha1 hash (and bug identifier --generate to do
so after the fact.)

Update all commands to take identifiers instead of
numbers, and fallback on index number if no identifier
is set
