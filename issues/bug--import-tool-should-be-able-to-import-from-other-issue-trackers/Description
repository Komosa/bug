Currently, you can manage issues and it would be easy
for other software to script an import from bug, but there
is no way to import issues in batch form into a bug repo.

There should be a separate bug-import tool. It should
create an issues/ directory of issues from another source
to encourage people to play with bug.

It should support, at a minimum, bugs everywhere and
github issues, since those are the two sources of users
most likely to be interested in trying bug.

If a bug is imported from GitHub, the commit message 
after it's closed should include "Closes #x" so that
the github issue is autoclosed.
