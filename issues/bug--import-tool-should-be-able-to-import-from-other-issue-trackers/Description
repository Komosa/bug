Currently, you can manage issues and it would be easy
for other software to script an import from bug, but there
is no way to import issues in batch form into a bug repo.

There should be a separate bug-import tool. It should
create an issues/ directory of issues from another source
to encourage people to play with bug.

It should support, at a minimum, bugs everywhere and
github issues, since those are the two sources of users
most likely to be interested in trying bug.

After that, an issues/ directory under bug-import can
track the status of other sources (Bugzilla? Jira?
Mantis? Too many to keep track of without a community
of interested users..)
