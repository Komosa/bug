When do you "bug close 1 2 3" for multiple issues by directory
index, after it coses 1, the index of the ones following 1 changes,
resulting in the wrong bugs being closed for 2 and 3. The "new" index
2 is closed from after 1 being removed, not the old "2" that the user
expected to be closed from when they did "bug list"

Possible solutions:
1. Only allow 1 issue to be closed at a time
2. Reverse sort the input before closing. (If this works it
   would be ideal, but I'd first need to verify that unlinking
   a file changes the rest of the indexes in a predictable order.)
