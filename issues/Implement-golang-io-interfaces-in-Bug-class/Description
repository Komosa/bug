The bugs.Bug class should implement some common
go interfaces so that you can easily intergrate
bug with other programs/libraries. In particular,
the interfaces:

1. io.Writer should append to the bug description
2. io.WriterAt should modify the description
3. io.Reader should print either the bug description
   or the full bug list BugIdx style output (not sure
   which, maybe have a flag in the bug struct to modify
   the two.)

This would make it much easier to integrate bugs
with logging systems when errors are encounterd by using
ie. io.MultiWriter
