There should be options to the "bug roadmap" command
to change the output format. In particular, there should
be options to:

1. Only show certain tags
2. Sort (or subsort) by different attributes than milestone,
   or reverse the sorting order
3. Include the "bug list" identifier 
4. Include tags in the output
