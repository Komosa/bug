There should be an option to autotrack issues with git,
if it's enabled there should be a thin wrapper around git
when creating/closing/editing bugs to ensure that they're
commited to the current branch.

Perhaps this can be done with a git alias so that you
use the command "git bug" instead of "bug" if you're
tracking with git, or perhaps there should be a hidden
configuration file in parallel of the issues directory
